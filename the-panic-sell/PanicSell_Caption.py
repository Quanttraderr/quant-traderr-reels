PanicSell_Caption.py
====================
Caption, hashtags and alt text for "The Panic Sell", plus the gate
that decides whether they are allowed to reach disk.

Two rules make this more than a text file:

  1. Every number in CAPTION must appear in figures.json, the file the pipeline
     wrote from asserted computation. A number retyped from memory fails.
  2. The gate runs BEFORE anything is written. A validator that writes first and
     complains second still ships the broken caption.

RUN
    python Topic_Caption.py
    -> caption.txt, hashtags.txt, alt_text.txt, metadata.json (this folder)
       exit 0 only if every check passes

CAPTION = """
Retail sees a crash and sells to stop the bleeding. A quant asks what that exit cost by the time it felt safe to come back.

The rule: own SPY, sell the day it closes -20% below its high, buy back only once the old high is reclaimed. The cash earns T-bills while it waits.

From Jan 1993 to Sep 2026 that rule fired 4 times: 2001, 2008, 2020, 2022. A dollar that was never touched grew to $31.90. The panic dollar ended at $13.71. It kept 43% of the money and handed 57% to fear. Every round trip sold low and bought back at least +26% higher, and it sat 11.6 years in cash. That gap is the price of waiting for the all clear.

The catch: a seller who buys back near the bottom does fine. This rule never does, and most people in a panic do not either. Four bear markets is a small sample, and taxes on every sale would make it worse.

Comment "PANIC" and I'll send you the code.

Follow @quant.traderr for the math behind the markets.
