Overnight_Caption.py
====================
Caption, hashtags and alt text for "The Market Earns at Night", plus the gate
that decides whether they are allowed to reach disk.

Two rules make this more than a text file:

  1. Every number in CAPTION must appear in figures.json, the file the pipeline
     wrote from asserted computation. A number retyped from memory fails.
  2. The gate runs BEFORE anything is written. A validator that writes first and
     complains second still ships the broken caption.

RUN
    python Topic_Caption.py
    -> caption.txt, hashtags.txt, alt_text.txt, metadata.json (this folder)
       exit 0 only if every check passes

Most traders think the market makes its money while it is open. The tape says the opposite: almost all of SPY's gain arrived while the exchange was closed.

Split every session in two. Night is yesterday's close to today's open. Day is today's open to today's close.

A dollar held only overnight from Feb 1993 to Sep 2026 grew to $25.12, that is +2,412%. A dollar held only during market hours ended at $1.26, +26%, and sat below where it started for most of those years. Multiply the halves and you get buy and hold, +3,071%, over 8,474 sessions. Night beat day in 24 of 34 calendar years. Quants call it the overnight drift.

The catch: this is not a free strategy. Buying every close and selling every open is two trades a day, and spreads plus fees eat most of the gap. Nobody fully agrees on why it exists either.

Comment "NIGHT" and I'll send you the code.

Follow @quant.traderr for the math behind the markets.
