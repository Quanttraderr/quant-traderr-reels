Seasonality_Caption.py
======================
Caption, hashtags and alt text for one reel, plus the gate that decides whether
they are allowed to reach disk.

Two rules make this more than a text file:

  1. Every number in CAPTION must appear in figures.json, the file the pipeline
     wrote from asserted computation. A number retyped from memory fails.
  2. The gate runs BEFORE anything is written. A validator that writes first and
     complains second still ships the broken caption.

RUN
    python Seasonality_Caption.py
    -> caption.txt, hashtags.txt, alt_text.txt, metadata.json (this folder)
       exit 0 only if every check passes

Retail knows that September is the bad month. A quant asks how wide the error bar on that is, and the answer ends the conversation.

Every month of every whole year of SPY since 1994, 384 months, on one torus. The long way round is the calendar from January to December. Once round the tube is one year. The tube is fatter where that month's average return is higher, and each patch is coloured by what that month actually did.

September averages -0.5%, the weakest of the twelve. It is also give or take 0.9, so that average sits less than one standard error from zero. November leads at 2.6%, and when you test twelve months at once you should expect one of them to look special by accident.

The catch: the shape is real arithmetic, not decoration. But 32 observations per month cannot separate most of these months from each other, and a calendar has never been a reason to buy anything.

Comment "CALENDAR" and I'll send the code that builds it.
