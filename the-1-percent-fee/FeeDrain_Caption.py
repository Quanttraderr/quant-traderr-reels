FeeDrain_Caption.py
===================
Caption, hashtags and alt text for "The 1% Fee", plus the gate
that decides whether they are allowed to reach disk.

Two rules make this more than a text file:

  1. Every number in CAPTION must appear in figures.json, the file the pipeline
     wrote from asserted computation. A number retyped from memory fails.
  2. The gate runs BEFORE anything is written. A validator that writes first and
     complains second still ships the broken caption.

RUN
    python Topic_Caption.py
    -> caption.txt, hashtags.txt, alt_text.txt, metadata.json (this folder)
       exit 0 only if every check passes

Retail sees a 1% fee and shrugs, it sounds like nothing. A quant compounds it.

$10,000 in SPY with dividends reinvested, Jan 1993 to Sep 2026. Left alone it grew to $318,993. The same money with a 1% yearly fee, the kind an advisor or an active fund charges, ended at $227,433. The fee took $91,560, that is 29% of the final pot, over 33.7 years. Half that fee, 0.5%, still costs 16%. A 2% fee costs 49%, almost half.

The damage is not the fee you pay this year. It is everything those dollars would have grown into. Quants call it fee drag.

The catch: SPY's own 0.09% is already inside the no fee line, and a manager who beats the index by more than the fee earns it. Most do not, but this chart does not test that. No taxes, no inflation.

Comment "FEE" and I'll send you the code.

Follow @quant.traderr for the math behind the markets.
