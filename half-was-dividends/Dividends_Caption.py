Dividends_Caption.py
====================
Caption, hashtags and alt text for "Half Was Dividends", plus the gate
that decides whether they are allowed to reach disk.

Two rules make this more than a text file:

  1. Every number in CAPTION must appear in figures.json, the file the pipeline
     wrote from asserted computation. A number retyped from memory fails.
  2. The gate runs BEFORE anything is written. A validator that writes first and
     complains second still ships the broken caption.

RUN
    python Topic_Caption.py
    -> caption.txt, hashtags.txt, alt_text.txt, metadata.json (this folder)
       exit 0 only if every check passes

Retail checks the price chart and thinks that is the return. A quant counts the cash the chart leaves out.

$10,000 in SPY in Jan 1993. On the price chart it is worth $173,572 by Sep 2026, 17.4x. With every dividend reinvested the same holding is worth $317,055, 31.7x. The difference, $143,484, never shows up on the chart. That is 45% of the money, from payouts most people never look at. Quants call it total return, and it is the number that counts.

The bottom layer of the block is the price. The orange layer on top is what the dividends added, compounding on itself for 33.7 years.

The catch: this is the same index counted two ways, not proof that dividend stocks beat other stocks. In a taxable account the dividends are taxed every year, which shrinks the top layer.

Comment "DIVIDEND" and I'll send you the code.

Follow @quant.traderr for the math behind the markets.
