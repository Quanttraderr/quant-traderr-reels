StopLoss_Caption.py
===================
Caption, hashtags and alt text for one reel, plus the gate that decides whether
they are allowed to reach disk.

Two rules make this more than a text file:

  1. Every number in CAPTION must appear in figures.json, the file the pipeline
     wrote from asserted computation. A number retyped from memory fails.
  2. The gate runs BEFORE anything is written. A validator that writes first and
     complains second still ships the broken caption.

RUN
    python StopLoss_Caption.py
    -> caption.txt, hashtags.txt, alt_text.txt, metadata.json (this folder)
       exit 0 only if every check passes

CAPTION = """
Retail sets a -10% stop and calls it risk management. A quant asks what the rest of that year did after the stop fired.

Every one-year window of SPY since 1993, started on every single trading day: 8,219 windows, each one a line. The red sheet is a stop at -10%.

31% of those windows touched -10% at some point. Of the windows that touched it, 50% still finished the year in profit, with a median close of +13%. Put the other way round, 19% of all green years dipped through the stop first. Only 36% of stop-outs ended the year below the stop itself.

The catch: the windows overlap heavily, so this is one index over one stretch of history, not 8,219 independent trials. The stop did its job in 2008. And on a single stock that can go to zero, a stop is a different tool entirely.

Comment "STOP" and I'll send the code that builds it.

Follow @quant.traderr for daily breakdowns of the math behind the markets.
